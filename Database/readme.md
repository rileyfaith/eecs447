# How to use this db

- Start by installing sqlite3 locally on your machine. (Google and install)
- Make sure you can type this into your terminal `sqlite3`
    - This should result in an interpreter. If not, your installation of sqlite3 is not correct.
- Once that works, clone this github repo and navigate to the Database folder through the command line.
- Type `sqlite3 library.db`
- This again should activate the sqlite3 command line interface. From here you should be able to run SQL commands normally
- Type `.exit` to exit the interpreter.
- Pls lmk if you guys can't access it right or somehting isn't working. The database tables should all be there, just empty. You can also look ath the `db.sql` file to fully understand the structure 
- I would also recommend getting an SQLite viewer through VSCode extensions. It allows you to look at all the tables within a GUI.
